            What a great place! Couldn't fault it. Great interiors, excellent customer service, loved my room- comfortable beds, clean bright bathroom with NUXE toiletries and breakfast was delicious! I can't fault it and I would recommended this place for families, couples and friends.

            Very distinctive Hotel. Comfortable and fun. Good living space and informal service. Adds to the travel experience and provides a special touch. Good for families. In my case heating system unsufficient in cold weather bringing a certain degree of uncomfort especially during the night. Thats why 3 stars ilo 4.

            We stayed here for a week for my husband business trip..Excellent place to stay! comfortable, clean and very convenient location near the tourist places or downtown.. very close to many shops and restaurants. All staff were courteous and welcoming. Excellent customer service and nice rooms and decorations (very vintage :) Augustin and Ornina was an amazing staff in vintage hotel... my favorite part is breakfast which i enjoyed eating their delicious bread.. :)

            Vintage hotel has a good location in between the centre (Marolles Antique place) and the trendy neighbourhoods of St Gilles and Ixelles.It is a cosy place with a nice vintage decoration indeed. The staff is friendly

            We put friends up in this hotel and they loved its vintage design. We had breakfast together and enjoyed it so much. It's close to Avenue Louise, close to a selection of very good restaurants and near public transport. Out of the ordinary, quirky place to stay.

            Equal favorite with Zoom Hotel, same concept, original, clean, super friendly staff, and excellent breakfast. Although near Avenue Louise, the hotel is not only affordable but also very quiet and guarantees a good night sleep. Note that there is no airco so perhaps in summer it can get hot. There a little patio in front of the hotel with a 70s style trailer for those who want to spend a night in an even more original manner. The breakfast was good, the 70s theme throughout the hotel is great. The bedroom was not huge but sufficient for a couple of nights, very comfortable bed and clean. Good wifi access in the room.

            I happened to stay only one night at vintage hotel for a very quick stay and found the place very enjoyable..The hotel is cosy and picturesque, really furnished in a "vintage" style. The room was smart and perfectly clean, and the manager very welcoming.
